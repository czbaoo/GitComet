Notes:
- `Cmd` and `Option` are the macOS names. `Ctrl` and `Alt` are the Windows/Linux equivalents.
- Some controls keep extra compatibility aliases in addition to the primary platform shortcut.
- Context menus also display per-entry shortcuts inline.

## App window shortcuts

These shortcuts apply in the normal GitComet window.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open a new window | `Cmd-N`, `Cmd-Shift-N` | `Ctrl-N`, `Ctrl-Shift-N` | |
| Open Settings | `Cmd-,` | `Ctrl-,` | |
| Open a repository | `Cmd-O` | `Ctrl-O` | |
| Open a workspace | `Cmd-Shift-R` | `Ctrl-Shift-R` | Lists saved workspaces. In an empty window the chosen workspace opens there; otherwise its own window is focused or opened. Also in the command palette and the app menu. |
| Go to a commit | `Cmd-G` | `Ctrl-G` | Opens the Go to dialog. Accepts a full or short SHA (4+ characters, unique), a branch, a tag, or any revision such as `HEAD~3`; matches are exact. In an embedded terminal the shell keeps `Ctrl-G`. |
| Toggle open and recently closed repositories | `Ctrl-Shift-A`, `Cmd-Shift-O`, `Option-Cmd-O` | `Ctrl-Shift-A`, `Ctrl-Shift-O` | In an embedded terminal on Windows/Linux, `Ctrl-Shift-A` keeps its terminal “Select All” behavior. |
| Open active repository in external code editor | `Cmd-Shift-E` | `Ctrl-Shift-E` | Only active when an external code editor is configured. |
| Show the open file in the file explorer | `Cmd-Shift-L` | `Ctrl-Shift-L` | Switches the sidebar to Files, expands the folders leading to the file, and scrolls it into view. |
| Open the repository's remote in a web browser | `Cmd-K` | `Ctrl-K` | Opens the remote's page on its host (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea/Codeberg, AWS CodeCommit, or a self-hosted forge). With several such remotes a menu lists them, `origin` first; `1`–`9` pick directly. Also in the command palette, the app menu, and a remote's right-click menu in the sidebar. In an embedded terminal on Windows/Linux the shell keeps `Ctrl-K`. |
| Close the active repository tab, or close the window if no repo tab can close | `Cmd-W` | `Ctrl-W` | |
| Close the active window | `Cmd-Shift-W` | `Ctrl-Shift-W` | |
| Previous repository tab | `Cmd-PageUp`, `Cmd-{`, `Option-Cmd-Left` | `Ctrl-PageUp`, `Ctrl-Shift-Tab` | |
| Next repository tab | `Cmd-PageDown`, `Cmd-}`, `Option-Cmd-Right` | `Ctrl-PageDown`, `Ctrl-Tab` | |
| Toggle full screen | `Ctrl-Cmd-F` | `F11` | |
| Quit GitComet | `Cmd-Q` | `Ctrl-Q` | |

macOS-only window-management shortcuts:
- `Cmd-M`: Minimize the active window.
- `Cmd-H`: Hide GitComet.
- `Option-Cmd-H`: Hide other applications.

## Text input shortcuts

File operation shortcuts are scoped to the Files explorer. See
[File management and Documents](file-management.md#explorer) for selection,
clipboard, rename, and filesystem Undo/Redo bindings.

These shortcuts apply when a GitComet text input has focus.

### Editing

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Select all | `Cmd-A` | `Ctrl-A` | `Ctrl-A` is also accepted on macOS. |
| Copy | `Cmd-C` | `Ctrl-C` | `Ctrl-C` is also accepted on macOS. |
| Paste | `Cmd-V` | `Ctrl-V` | `Ctrl-V` is also accepted on macOS. |
| Cut | `Cmd-X` | `Ctrl-X` | `Ctrl-X` is also accepted on macOS. |
| Undo | `Cmd-Z` | `Ctrl-Z` | |
| Redo | `Cmd-Shift-Z` | `Ctrl-Shift-Z` | |
| Show the character palette | `Ctrl-Cmd-Space` | None | macOS only. |
| Delete to line start / end | `Cmd-Backspace`, `Cmd-Delete` | `Ctrl-Shift-Backspace`, `Ctrl-Shift-Delete` | With the caret at the end of a single-line input, such as a search box, deleting to the line start clears it. At the start or end of a line, deletes the line break instead. |

### Cursor movement and selection

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Move by character or line | Arrow keys | Arrow keys | `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down` |
| Select by character or line | `Shift` + arrow keys | `Shift` + arrow keys | |
| Move to document start / end | `Cmd-Home`, `Cmd-End` | `Ctrl-Home`, `Ctrl-End` | Picker search inputs also select the first / last result. |
| Move to line start / end | `Cmd-Left`, `Cmd-Right`, `Home`, `End` | `Home`, `End` | |
| Select to line start / end | `Cmd-Shift-Left`, `Cmd-Shift-Right`, `Shift-Home`, `Shift-End` | `Shift-Home`, `Shift-End` | |
| Move by page | `PageUp`, `PageDown` | `PageUp`, `PageDown` | |
| Select by page | `Shift-PageUp`, `Shift-PageDown` | `Shift-PageUp`, `Shift-PageDown` | |

### Word movement and word deletion

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Move left / right by word | `Option-Left`, `Option-Right` | `Ctrl-Left`, `Ctrl-Right` | |
| Select left / right by word | `Option-Shift-Left`, `Option-Shift-Right` | `Ctrl-Shift-Left`, `Ctrl-Shift-Right` | |
| Delete word to the left / right | `Option-Backspace`, `Option-Delete` | `Ctrl-Backspace`, `Ctrl-Delete` | |

Compatibility note:
- GitComet also keeps the opposite modifier family wired in text inputs where practical, so `Alt`-based word movement and `Ctrl`-based editing aliases remain available as portability fallbacks.
- Diff-navigation fallbacks stay active from focused GitComet text inputs for `F1`, `F4`, `F2`, `F3`, `F7`, `Shift-F7`, `Alt-Up`, and `Alt-Down` when the input does not handle those keys itself.

### Commit composer

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commit staged changes | `Cmd-Enter` | `Ctrl-Enter` | Commit message input only, and only when the Commit action is enabled. |

## History view shortcuts

These shortcuts apply while the commit history list is showing.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Find a commit | `Cmd-F` | `Ctrl-F` | Opens the find bar over the history. Matches the commit summary or the author (each on its own), or the start of the SHA (4+ hex characters), across the whole history, not only the loaded rows. Typing selects the first match. With the bar already open, refocuses it with the query selected. |
| Find options | `Aa`, `W`, `.*` buttons | `Aa`, `W`, `.*` buttons | Match Case, Whole Word and Regex toggles, as in diff search; toggling one searches again and selects the first match. Without Match Case, plain text ignores ASCII letter case only (`É` and `é` differ), while a regex ignores Unicode case. The SHA prefix always ignores case and Whole Word, and applies only while Regex is off. An invalid regex reads "Invalid regex" and searches nothing. |
| Next match | `Enter`, `F3` | `Enter`, `F3` | Selects the next match below the selected commit, wrapping to the top. `Enter` only from the find bar; `F3` also from the list. Also the ↓ button. |
| Previous match | `Shift-Enter`, `F2` | `Shift-Enter`, `F2` | Selects the previous match above the selected commit, wrapping to the bottom. `Shift-Enter` only from the find bar; `F2` also from the list. Also the ↑ button. |
| Close the find bar | `Escape` | `Escape` | Also the × button. Focus returns to the history list. |

## Picker shortcuts

These shortcuts apply while a picker's search input has focus, including file history.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Previous / next result | `Up`, `Down` | `Up`, `Down` | `Shift-Tab` / `Tab` also navigate. |
| First / last result | `Cmd-Home`, `Cmd-End` | `Ctrl-Home`, `Ctrl-End` | `Ctrl-Home` / `Ctrl-End` also work on macOS. |
| Previous / next page | `PageUp`, `PageDown` | `PageUp`, `PageDown` | Moves by one visible page and stops at the first / last result. |
| Activate selected result | `Enter` | `Enter` | In file history, opens the file at that commit, following renames. |
| Close menu or picker | `Escape` | `Escape` | Closes a row's context menu first, keeping the picker open. |

File history filters by SHA, summary, and author while preserving history order. Right-click a row to open a revision or its parent, show the file's changes, reveal the commit in history, copy its SHA, or use the standard commit actions. Copying keeps the history picker open.

## Embedded terminal shortcuts

These shortcuts apply when the embedded terminal has focus.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Copy terminal selection | `Cmd-C` | `Ctrl-Shift-C` | Disabled/no-op without a terminal selection. |
| Paste clipboard text | `Cmd-V` | `Ctrl-Shift-V` | Clipboard CRLF/CR line endings are normalized to LF. Bracketed paste is used when the shell enables it. |
| Select all terminal buffer | `Cmd-A` | `Ctrl-Shift-A` | Selects the scrollback buffer plus the visible terminal grid. |
| Scroll terminal history | `Shift-PageUp`, `Shift-PageDown`, `Shift-Home`, `Shift-End` | `Shift-PageUp`, `Shift-PageDown`, `Shift-Home`, `Shift-End` | Only in the normal screen buffer. |

Shell-input note:
- Plain `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-V`, and `Ctrl-A` keep going to the shell instead of GitComet clipboard handling.

Mouse and menu behavior:
- Left-drag selects visible terminal text.
- Right-click focuses the terminal and opens a menu without clearing the current selection.
- The terminal menu includes Copy, Paste, Select All, Clear, and Open in External Terminal.
- Clear sends `Ctrl-L` to the shell and is disabled when the embedded terminal is disconnected.

## Diff view shortcuts

These shortcuts apply in the main diff panel, including conflict resolution views where noted.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Scope / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open file history | `Ctrl-H` | `Ctrl-H` | Working-tree files and files viewed at a commit; not while a text field has focus. |
| Search the current diff | `Cmd-F` | `Ctrl-F` | If rendered markdown preview is open, GitComet switches back to source mode before opening search. |
| Insert a newline in diff search | `Shift-Enter` | `Shift-Enter` | Diff search only. The search box also has Match Case, Whole Word, and Regex toggles. |
| Previous search match | `F2` | `F2` | While diff search is open. The ↑ button in the search box does the same. |
| Next search match | `F3` | `F3` | While diff search is open. The ↓ button in the search box does the same. |
| Close search, clear selection, or close the current diff | `Escape` | `Escape` | Exact behavior depends on the current diff state. |
| Previous file in the status list | `F1` | `F1` | Working tree and conflict-oriented diff flows. |
| Next file in the status list | `F4` | `F4` | Working tree and conflict-oriented diff flows. |
| Previous change | `F2`, `Shift-F7`, `Option-Up` | `F2`, `Shift-F7`, `Alt-Up` | Moves one change block (a run of consecutive changed lines) at a time, landing on its first line, in Full, Collapsed, and whole-commit diffs alike. The conflict resolver moves by conflict instead. |
| Next change | `F3`, `F7`, `Option-Down` | `F3`, `F7`, `Alt-Down` | Same unit as Previous change. With nothing selected, goes to the first change block. |
| Switch to inline diff | `Option-I` | `Alt-I` | Raw file diff only. Conflict resolver keeps split layout. |
| Enter or leave the file editor | `Option-E` | `Alt-E` | Not while a text field has focus. Escape also leaves the editor. |
| Save the edited file | `Cmd-S` | `Ctrl-S` | Only while the editor's buffer has focus; outside it the same chord stages the file. |
| Switch to split diff | `Option-S` | `Alt-S` | Raw file diff only. |
| Toggle whitespace characters | `Option-W` | `Alt-W` | Text diff / conflict diff only. |
| Stage or unstage the current working-tree file and advance to the adjacent file | `Space` | `Space` | Raw working-tree file diff only, and not while the diff search input has focus. |
| Select all diff text | `Cmd-A` | `Ctrl-A` | File preview and text-selection flows. |
| Copy selected diff text | `Cmd-C` | `Ctrl-C` | File preview and text-selection flows. |
| Pick conflict result `Base / Ours / Theirs / Both` | `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` | `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` | Conflict resolver only. |
| Previous unresolved conflict | `Shift-F2` | `Shift-F2` | Conflict resolver only. Skips conflicts you have already resolved; works while the resolved-output editor has focus. |
| Next unresolved conflict | `Shift-F3` | `Shift-F3` | Conflict resolver only. Skips conflicts you have already resolved; works while the resolved-output editor has focus. |
| First / last delta | `Cmd-Home` / `Cmd-End` | `Ctrl-Home` / `Ctrl-End` | Conflict resolver only. Not active while the resolved-output editor has focus, which keeps them for cursor movement. |
| Align selected lines manually | `Cmd-Y` | `Ctrl-Y` | Conflict resolver only (kdiff3 manual diff help). |
| Clear all manual alignments | `Cmd-Shift-Y` | `Ctrl-Shift-Y` | Conflict resolver only. |

Preview-mode note:
- Rendered markdown preview hides the raw diff navigation controls and ignores the raw-diff-only view toggles, whitespace toggle, and conflict navigation hotkeys until you return to source mode.
- The diff navigation keys above still work while a GitComet text input has focus, but search activation, `Escape`, view toggles, and staging `Space` remain tied to the active diff surface rather than text inputs.

## Context menu shortcuts

Context-menu keyboard behavior is the same on every platform:
- `Up` / `Down`: move the selection.
- `Enter`: activate the selected item, or the first enabled item if nothing is selected.
- `Escape`: close the menu.
- Single-letter or digit shortcuts shown inline activate the matching entry.

Additional note:
- Some menus also show clipboard-style shortcuts such as `Ctrl+C`; those reflect the underlying view shortcut rather than the menu's generic single-letter dispatcher.

## Focused diff window

These shortcuts apply in the standalone focused diff window opened for difftool-style flows.

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Close the window | `Cmd-W`, `Ctrl-W`, `Escape`, `Q` | `Ctrl-W`, `Escape`, `Q` | `Ctrl-W` remains accepted on macOS as an extra alias. |
| Previous change | `F2`, `Shift-F7`, `Option-Up` | `F2`, `Shift-F7`, `Alt-Up` | One change block at a time, as in the main diff view. |
| Next change | `F3`, `F7`, `Option-Down` | `F3`, `F7`, `Alt-Down` | One change block at a time, as in the main diff view. |
