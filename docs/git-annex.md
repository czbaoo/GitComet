# git-annex

GitComet works with repositories that manage large files with [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com). GitComet does not move annexed content itself. Content commands run `git annex`, so location tracking, the numcopies check and special remotes behave exactly as they do in a terminal. Ordinary Git commands still go through Git.

**Settings → Executables** shows whether Git can run `git annex`. When it is **Not found**, GitComet still recognises annexed files, but every git-annex command is listed disabled with "(install git-annex)". git-annex older than 10.20230626 has no `pull` and `push`; GitComet runs the same one-way `git annex sync` instead.

Showing what is annexed never runs git-annex: file rows, presence and the sidebar section are read from Git, the local `git-annex` branch and `.git/annex`. git-annex runs only for commands you start and for **Where is it?** and **Find unused content…**.

## What GitComet shows

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| Changed-file rows and commit details | An **annex** chip. It turns to the warning colour when the content is not in this clone. |
| Diff pane | A card with the key and size of each side. When the content is here, the real diff sits below the card, including images and older versions of unlocked files. **Where is it?** lists the repositories git-annex has recorded as holding each displayed version, including historical or deleted files. Untrusted copies are labelled. It reads git-annex's location log and does not contact the remotes. |
| Sidebar | A **git-annex** section with this clone, other repositories and special remotes, their type and trust level, and the numcopies setting or adjusted-branch mode. The section appears only in repositories that use git-annex. With the sidebar collapsed, the same section opens from its icon in the rail. |
| Branch lists | The `git-annex` and `synced/*` branches are hidden, locally and on remotes: in the sidebar, the branch badge's picker, the delete, rebase-onto and branch-from lists, and the upstream picker. A checked-out bookkeeping branch stays listed. |
| Branch badge | An adjusted branch reads as its base branch, for example **main · adjusted (unlocked)**. |
| Hook activity | Transfer progress for get, copy and move. |

## Commands

| Command | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Get content, Drop local content, Copy to *remote*, Move to *remote*, Unlock, Lock | Changed-file row menu, for annexed files |
| Drop even without other copies… | Changed-file row menu, behind a confirmation |
| Add to git-annex | Changed-file row menu, for untracked files |
| Get content, Where is it? | Diff card |
| Pull with git-annex, Get all annexed content | **Pull** menu |
| Push with git-annex, Sync with git-annex | **Push** menu |
| Sync, get everything, switch to or leave an adjusted branch, add or enable a special remote, set numcopies, describe this repository, check content | Right-click the **git-annex** sidebar header |
| Get from, copy to, move to or drop from one repository; mark as trusted, semitrusted or untrusted; describe; enable a special remote | Right-click a repository in the **git-annex** section |
| Initialize git-annex in this clone | **git-annex** section, until the clone is initialized |
| Refresh annexed files left stale | **git-annex** section when a cancelled or failed command left files reading as modified; also the header menu |
| Find unused content…, then Drop or Drop without verified copies | Right-click the **git-annex** sidebar header |
| Open git-annex webapp…, Stop git-annex assistant | Right-click the **git-annex** sidebar header; Stop appears while the assistant runs |
| Sync, pull, push, get all, check, adjust, leave adjusted, initialize, refresh, find unused content, open the webapp | Command palette, under **git-annex** |

git-annex refuses to drop content when it cannot verify enough copies elsewhere. GitComet shows that refusal with git-annex's reason and suggests copying first or using **Move to**. **Drop even without other copies…** passes `--force` only after you confirm.

**Mark as trusted…** asks you to confirm before trusting a repository. git-annex then counts its recorded copies without checking that they still exist, which can cause data loss if those copies disappear. Semitrusted and untrusted changes apply immediately.

GitComet never lets git-annex commit. Sync runs with `--no-commit`, so your changes stay in the working tree until you commit them. The one exception is the webapp, which you start on purpose: it runs the git-annex assistant, which adds and commits changes by itself until you stop it. GitComet asks before starting it.

**Find unused content…** lists old versions no branch or tag uses any more, corrupt copies `fsck` set aside, and partial downloads, with their sizes. **Drop** keeps anything git-annex cannot verify in another repository; **Drop without verified copies** deletes it anyway. Both refresh the list first, so they drop what is unused at that moment.

To add a special remote, enter the name, the type and its `key=value` parameters, for example:

```
backup directory directory=/mnt/usb encryption=none
```

Quote values that contain spaces, for example `directory="/Volumes/My Backup"`. Both add and enable prompts accept single or double quotes and backslash escapes. Values are passed directly to git-annex without shell expansion.

A special remote another clone added is listed with its type but is not usable here until you enable it. Right-click it and choose **Enable *name* in this clone…**. Most types need only the name; a `directory` remote needs its path on this computer again:

```
backup directory=/media/usb/annex
```

## Settings

**Settings → Large files** has three options:

- **Hide git-annex bookkeeping branches** is on by default.
- **Use git-annex pull and push on adjusted branches** is on by default. On an adjusted branch, Pull, Push and commit & push run `git annex pull` and `git annex push`. A plain merge into an adjusted branch would commit the adjusted files to the wrong branch, and a plain push would publish the adjusted branch. Pull from another branch, push with tags and force push have no git-annex equivalent, so GitComet refuses them there; check out the base branch to use them. Without git-annex installed, Pull and Push are refused on an adjusted branch for the same reason.
- **git-annex pull, push and sync also move file content** is off by default, so these commands only exchange branches.

## Troubleshooting

- **A drop was refused.** Copy the file to another repository first, raise trust in a repository that has it, or lower numcopies with **Set number of copies…**.
- **Files read as modified after a cancelled download.** git-annex updates Git's index at the end of a command, which a cancel skips. GitComet refreshes it after every git-annex command it runs; for files left by other tools, use **Refresh** in the git-annex section.
- **The git-annex section lists no repositories, or misses one.** The list comes from this clone's `git-annex` branch, so it is empty until the clone is initialized. Repositories another clone added appear once a git-annex pull or sync merges its `git-annex` branch; a plain fetch does not.
